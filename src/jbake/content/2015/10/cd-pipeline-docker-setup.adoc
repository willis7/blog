Automation code is becoming increasingly more complex, and with that comes the danger to your live services. Imagine a script that creates jobs in Jenkins which accidentally introduces an infinite loop. Expect your server to run out of memory very quickly! To ensure we don't accidentally bring down a production service whilst testing its a good idea to build sacrificial services. In the past I would create Vagrant environments, but these boxes were heavyweight and slow.....

The purpose of this blog is to show you how you can provision an integrated CD environment using the power of Docker and Docker Compose.
