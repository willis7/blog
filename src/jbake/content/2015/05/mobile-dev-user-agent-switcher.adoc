== Problem

When adding mobile support to your application you want to quickly see what it looks like on multiple devices. While we can use a real mobile device to test things out, this process can be quite cumbersome and time consuming. It's best to find a plugin for our browser in order to switch the user agent settings automatically.

== Solution

Whilst this is by no means the only solution, I have found it to be the easiest. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher/ffhkkpnppgnfaobgihpdblnhmmbodake?hl=en[User-Agent Switcher] is an extension for the Chrome browser which lets you easily switch a browser to a mobile device.
