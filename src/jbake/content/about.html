Hi, my name is Sion. I am a Computer Games Development graduate whos been
working as a Software Build Manager for the past 5 years. I am a huge fan of all
things programming or software development related.

Recently I've found myself playing with all things groovy related such as Gradle,
Grails and the language itself.
